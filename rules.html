    <div class="title">Patrolling <span class="emoji">🚔</span></div>
    <p>As a staff member, you need to patrol around the map to lookout for any FRP, GTA driving, VDM and people who are using liveries/gear they can’t use unless they are applied to a team in our discord server.</p>
    <p>You also need to be on the police or sheriff team to be patrolling and being on duty as a staff member. You cannot be on the civilian team, fire department, or department of transportation.</p>
    <p>If you are on duty as a staff member, you are required to put on the staff clothes that are specially made for our staff team and also be patrolling around in a vehicle with the provided staff livery on.</p>
    <p>The only tools you are allowed to use on duty are the taser, the cuffs, the MDT and the stop stick.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="title">Punishments <span class="emoji">⚖️</span></div>
    <p>As a staff member, you are required to know what punishment you need to give to a person and how they work.</p>
    <p>There are 4 kinds of punishments you can give to a person: VW, W1, kick or ban (only admins can ban people).</p>
    <p>If someone gets 2 times a VW, they will get a W1, if they already have a W2( from previous moderations) and you give them another W1, they will be added together to a W2, and it is the same to get to W3 and to W1. So basically if you give someone a punishment, they will add up.</p>
    <p>The punishments only rest for 1 day and you can’t use those punishments from the day before to add up.</p>
    <p>If you want to kick/ban someone you need to do the following things: say why they are getting kicked, then ask if they have any questions about it, if they don’t have any, then you kick them.</p>
    <p>If you are a moderator and you want to ban someone because he did a bannable offense, then you should first ask if there is an admin+ on, if there aren’t any online, you need to make a ban request in the channel, so an admin+ now they need to be kicked when that person rejoins the server. If there aren’t any admin+ online at the moment you want to ban someone, you kick them.</p>
    <p>If you give someone a punishment, you always need to log it in the channel, if you don’t log it, you will get a warning.</p>
